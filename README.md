# MATH5411
In HKUST, Advanced Probabiliy I is a fundamental course for students study statistics and machine learning. It's also part of the PhD Qualification Exams of Math Dept. After passing this exam this month, I decided to share the study materials **all you need** for MATH 5411 Advanced Probability I. This repository includes:

* 💕 [Detailed Class Notes Taken by Me](https://github.com/Dolores2333/MATH5411/tree/main/ClassNotes?raw=true)
* 💯 [2020 Final Exams and My Answers](https://github.com/Dolores2333/MATH5411/tree/main/FinalAnswers)
* 💯 [2020 PhD Qualification Exams and My Answers](https://github.com/Dolores2333/MATH5411/tree/main/QualificationExam)
* 🔥 [Probability Theory and Examples with Exercise Solutions](https://github.com/Dolores2333/MATH5411/tree/main/TextBook)

### Bonus ⭐
Both final exam and qualification exam are based 💯 on the knowledge introduced by Prof. BAO in class. Sometimes, it helps to refer to the [notes](https://www.math.ust.hk/~makchen/MATH5411/MATH5411.htm) taken by last lecturer of this course, Professor Kani CHEN .
